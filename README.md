# A work in progress: March Madness application

This is a March Madness application that will that will be able to
generate random picks from the NCAA March Madness tournament
and distribute them among 16 pool participants.

This is a long term project as it is designed to test my knowledge
of Ruby, Rails as well as my ability to conceptualize and normalize a database.
