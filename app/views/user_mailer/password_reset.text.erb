It's like you don't care.

Hello there <%= @user.first_name %>

Seeing as you are a forgetful person this might be hard for you, but we'll try
it anyway.

Copy and past the link below into your browser.  Follow instructions.

<%= edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

Really, you can do it.  But just in case, the link will expire in 2 hours.

If you did not request this email, you're in more trouble than we thought, but
the good news is your March Madness password isn't going to change.
